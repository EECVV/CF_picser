**🚀 Just shipped Picser - Free GitHub Image Hosting with jsDelivr CDN!**

After struggling with expensive image hosting services and broken URLs, I built something different.

**💡 The Problem:**
• Image hosting services charge monthly fees
• URLs break when services shut down
• No permanent solution for open-source projects
• CDN costs add up quickly for side projects

**✨ The Solution - Picser:**
• Upload images to GitHub repositories
• Get lightning-fast jsDelivr CDN URLs automatically
• Permanent commit-based URLs (work even if repo is deleted!)
• Completely free and self-hostable

**🛠️ Tech Stack:**
• Next.js 15 with App Router
• TypeScript for type safety
• Tailwind CSS for modern UI
• GitHub API for storage
• jsDelivr CDN for global delivery

**🎨 Design Philosophy:**
Built with glassmorphism design, focusing on simplicity and speed. The UI prioritizes the upload flow with clear visual feedback and smart URL management.

**📊 Key Features:**
✅ 6 different URL formats (GitHub, Raw, jsDelivr)
✅ Global CDN with 100+ edge locations
✅ Upload history with smart badges
✅ Mobile-responsive design
✅ One-click copy functionality
✅ API for programmatic use

**🌟 Why This Matters:**
In a world of subscription fatigue, developers need reliable, free alternatives. Picser leverages existing free services (GitHub + jsDelivr) to create something sustainable.

## 📖 **The Story Behind Picser**

### **🎯 The Problem That Started It All**

As a developer constantly working on side projects and open-source contributions, I faced a recurring frustration: **image hosting**. Every README, blog post, or demo needed images, but:

- **Paid services** like Cloudinary, AWS S3, or ImageKit charge monthly fees
- **Free services** often have storage limits or disappear over time
- **Direct uploads** to platforms break when you change hosting
- **CDN costs** add up quickly for multiple projects

I needed something **permanent**, **free**, and **reliable**.

### **💡 The "Aha!" Moment**

The breakthrough came while working on documentation for an open-source project. I realized:

1. **GitHub** already stores my code for free with unlimited public repos
2. **jsDelivr** provides free CDN for GitHub content with global edge caching
3. **Commit-based URLs** are permanent - they work even if files are later deleted

Why not combine these existing free services into a seamless image hosting solution?

### **🛠️ Technical Decisions & Thinking**

#### **Why Next.js 15?**

- **App Router**: Modern routing with better performance
- **Server Components**: Optimal for API integration
- **TypeScript**: Type safety for better developer experience
- **Easy deployment**: One-click deploy to Vercel/Cloudflare

#### **Why Tailwind CSS + Glassmorphism?**

- **Modern aesthetic**: Clean, professional look
- **Responsive by default**: Works on all devices
- **Utility-first**: Fast development and easy maintenance
- **Glassmorphism**: Trendy design that feels premium

#### **Why GitHub + jsDelivr?**

- **GitHub API**: Reliable, well-documented, generous rate limits
- **jsDelivr**: 100+ global edge locations, 99.9% uptime
- **Commit-based URLs**: Immutable, permanent links
- **Free forever**: Both services are sustainable and established

### **🎨 Design Philosophy**

#### **Simplicity First**

- **One-page app**: Everything accessible without navigation
- **Drag & drop**: Intuitive upload experience
- **Smart defaults**: Best URL format automatically selected
- **Clear feedback**: Visual indicators for every action

#### **Performance Obsessed**

- **CDN prioritization**: jsDelivr URLs shown first
- **Optimized images**: Next.js image optimization
- **Lazy loading**: Better page performance
- **Minimal JavaScript**: Fast initial load

#### **Developer Experience**

- **Multiple URL formats**: Choose what works for your use case
- **Copy with one click**: Streamlined workflow
- **Upload history**: Track all your images
- **API endpoints**: Programmatic access for automation

### **🔧 Technical Implementation Highlights**

#### **Smart URL Management**

```typescript
// Prioritize commit-based CDN URLs for permanence
const bestUrl = upload.urls?.jsdelivr_commit || upload.urls?.jsdelivr || upload.url;
```

#### **Modern UI Components**

- **Glassmorphism cards**: `bg-white/70 backdrop-blur-sm`
- **Gradient buttons**: Dynamic color transitions
- **Smart badges**: Visual indicators for CDN status
- **Responsive grid**: Works on mobile and desktop

#### **API Design**

- **RESTful endpoints**: `/api/upload`, `/api/public-upload`
- **Multiple formats**: Generate 6 different URL types
- **Error handling**: Graceful failure with clear messages
- **Type safety**: Full TypeScript coverage

### **🚀 Future Vision**

#### **Short Term**

- **Batch uploads**: Multiple files at once
- **Image optimization**: Automatic compression
- **Custom domains**: Use your own CDN domain
- **Analytics**: Track image usage

#### **Long Term**

- **Team collaboration**: Shared repositories
- **Image editing**: Basic crop/resize tools
- **API rate limiting**: Fair usage policies
- **Premium features**: Advanced organization tools

### **💭 Lessons Learned**

#### **Build on Giants**

Instead of reinventing the wheel, I leveraged existing, proven services. This reduced complexity and increased reliability.

#### **Focus on UX**

The best technology is invisible. Users just want to upload an image and get a URL - everything else should be seamless.

#### **Sustainability Matters**

By using free, established services, Picser can remain free indefinitely without burning through VC money or requiring subscriptions.

#### **Open Source First**

Making it open source means others can:

- Self-host for privacy
- Contribute improvements
- Learn from the code
- Build upon the foundation

### **🌟 Impact & Goals**

**Personal Impact:**

- Solved my own problem first
- Created something I use daily
- Built with modern, enjoyable tech stack

**Community Impact:**

- Free alternative to paid services
- Educational resource for Next.js + GitHub API
- Template for similar projects
- Sustainable solution that won't disappear

**Technical Impact:**

- Demonstrates modern React patterns
- Shows effective API design
- Example of good TypeScript usage
- Responsive design implementation
